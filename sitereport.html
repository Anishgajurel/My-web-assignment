   <h1> MY EXPERIENCE OF WEB LEARNING</h1>
   <p> The task associated with creating, buildings, and maintaining websites and web application that run online on a browser. This is my first experience of of web learning. The experience of web learning is very interesting. In this web development we learn how to make a website using different html and css tags. We learn about github and how to create repo in github, how to add, commit and push which help us to secure our file and folder in a systematic order.</p>
   <p>
   I learned about html structure how tags are used and how to use it in a proper form. At first html was new to me so it was difficult to understand but when i enagage in html and used to do code its quite easy for me so i keep practicing which helps me alot for coding.</p>
   <p>
      I was having problem but later on when my tutor guide me it feels good and i keep on practicing which leads me to form a good website. coding is interesting when we keep on practicing. In this webdevelopment we got to know about different types of coding. I got to know how to animate the page , how to design and how to add images also i learn how to make forms.</p>
      <p>
      Overall the experience of learing coding is interesting and I am thankful that i can code in a good way. SO i want to thanks to my module tutor and university of northhampton for this opportunity!!</p>
